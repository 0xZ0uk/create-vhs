title: Why VHS?
description: VHS is a web development framework built for the modern web
---

VHS was built for [React](https://react.dev)/[NextJS](https://nextjs.org) developers who want to adopt [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com), but want to keep a familiar developer experience to the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg). VHS is built on top of popular libraries like: [Vike](https://vike.dev), [Hono](https://hono.dev), and, of course, [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com).


Made for building **full-stack end-to-end typesafe** apps, with the best performance and DX mind.
