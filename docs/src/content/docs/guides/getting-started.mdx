description: A guide on how to start using VHS
---

Welcome to VHS! This guide will walk you through scaffolding a new project, connecting your database, and starting the development server. By the end, you'll have a full-stack, type-safe application running locally and ready for you to build something amazing.

## Prerequisites

All you need to get started is **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)**. Bun is our all-in-one toolkit: it acts as the JavaScript runtime, package manager, and bundler for this project.


import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside>You can use Node, along with a different package manager, if you prefer.</Aside>

## 1. Scaffolding a New Project

To create a new VHS project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bun create vhs@latest my-vhs-app
```

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

Your project needs a few environment variables to run, most importantly the connection string for your database.

First, copy the example environment file to create your own local version:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the newly created .env file. You will need to provide a connection string to a PostgreSQL-compatible database (e.g., from Vercel, Neon, Supabase, or your own local instance).

Update the `DATABASE_URL` variable with your actual database connection string.

```.env
# .env
# Replace this with your actual database connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@hostname:5432/db"
```

## 3. Sync Your Database Schema

Before running the application, you need to sync its schema with the database you provided in the previous step.

The starter project comes with a default schema defined in `src/server/db/schema.ts`. To create the necessary tables in your database, run the `db:push` command:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

This command uses Drizzle Kit to introspect your schema and sync your database to match it. You should see a confirmation that the tables were created successfully.

## 4. Run the Development Server

And that's it for the setup! You're now ready to start the development server.

```
bun dev
```

This will start the Vike development server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see your VHS application running live, with hot-reloading enabled for both the frontend and backend.

## Next Steps

Congratulations, you have a fully operational VHS application! ðŸš€
