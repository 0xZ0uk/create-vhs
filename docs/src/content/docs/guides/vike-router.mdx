Routing is at the core of any web application. VHS uses Vike, which provides a powerful and flexible routing system. While it defaults to an intuitive filesystem-based approach, it offers powerful escape hatches for when you need more control.

This guide covers the main ways to define, organize, and protect your routes.

## 1. Filesystem Routing

By default, Vike maps the folder structure inside src/pages/ directly to URL routes. The key principle is that folders define the route, and special + files inside them define the route's behavior.

Vike always ignores the pages/ and index/ directories when creating the URL path.

<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
    <li>`src/pages/index/+Page.tsx` → `/`</li>
    <li>`src/pages/about/+Page.tsx` → `/about`</li>
    <li>`src/pages/posts/+Page.tsx` → `/posts`</li>
</ul>

### Dynamic Routes

To create a route with a dynamic segment, use the @ prefix. This is perfect for things like user profiles or blog posts.

**Example**: `src/pages/users/@userId/+Page.tsx`

This route will match URLs like `/users/123` and `/users/jane-doe`. You can access the dynamic parameter in your server logic via the pageContext:

<Code title='TypeScript' lang="ts" code={`
// in a .page.server.tsx or +guard.ts file
import type { PageContext } from 'vike/types';

export function data(pageContext: PageContext) {
    // Access the dynamic part of the URL
    const userId = pageContext.routeParams.userId;
    // ... fetch user data
}
`} />

### Organizing with Route Groups

You can group related routes into folders with parentheses (). These folders are ignored in the URL, but they are incredibly useful for applying shared layouts or configurations to a set of pages.

**Example**:
<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
    <li>`src/pages/(marketing)/about/+Page.tsx` → `/about`</li>
    <li>`src/pages/(marketing)/contact/+Page.tsx` → `/contact`</li>
</ul>

Now, you can add a `+Layout.tsx` or `+config.ts` inside the (marketing) folder to apply a specific layout or configuration only to the marketing pages.

## 2. Advanced Routing with +route.ts

Sometimes, your desired URL doesn't match your file structure. For these cases, you can create a +route.ts file to explicitly define the route for all files within that same directory.

### Route Strings

The simplest way to override filesystem routing is with a Route String.

<Code title='src/pages/product-details/+route.ts' lang="ts" code={`
    // This defines the URL for '/src/pages/product-details/+Page.tsx'
    export default '/product/@id'
`} />

Now, the URL `/product/123` will be handled by the page component in the product-details folder.

### Route Functions

For ultimate control, you can export a Route Function. This allows for complex, programmatic logic, such as using regular expressions or integrating third-party routing libraries.

<Code title='src/pages/product-editor/+route.ts' lang="ts" code={`
import type { RouteSync } from 'vike/types'

export const route: RouteSync = (pageContext) => {
    // Example: only match if a specific query parameter exists
    if (pageContext.urlPathname === '/edit' && pageContext.urlParsed.search.edit_token) {
    return { routeParams: { /* ... */ } }
    }
    return false
}
`} />

## 3. Protecting Routes with +guard.ts

A common requirement is to protect pages from unauthorized access. Vike handles this elegantly with `+guard.ts` files. A guard file in a directory applies to all sub-routes within it.

The `guard()` hook runs on the server before your page is rendered. You can check for user permissions and redirect or deny access by throwing `render()`.

**Example**: Protecting an admin section.

<Code title='src/pages/admin/+guard.ts' lang="ts" code={`
import { render } from 'vike/abort'
import type { GuardAsync } from 'vike/types'

export const guard: GuardAsync = async (pageContext) => {
    // This logic runs on the server
    const { user } = pageContext; // Assuming user is available in pageContext
    if (!user || !user.isAdmin) {
        // Deny access and render the 401 Unauthorized page
        throw render(401, "You aren't allowed to access this page.")
    }
}
`} />

Now, any page inside `src/pages/admin/` is protected by this logic.

## 4. Other Key Route Files

As we covered previously, you can use other `+` files to manage all aspects of a route:

<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
    <li>`+Page.tsx`: The main SolidJS component for the UI.</li>
    <li>`+config.ts`: Sets route-specific configuration like the Layout or title.</li>
    <li>`+Head.tsx`: Manages the document `<head>`.</li>
    <li>`+onPageTransitionStart.ts`: Handles client-side navigation lifecycle hooks.</li>
    <li>`_error/+Page.tsx`: A special route for handling 404 and 500 errors.</li>
</ul>
