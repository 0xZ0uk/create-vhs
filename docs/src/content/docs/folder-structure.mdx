title: Folder Structure
---

The folder structure of a VHS project is designed to be straightforward and scalable. We've kept it familiar for anyone coming from the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg)/[NextJS](https://nextjs.org), aiming for a logical separation between your client-side code, server-side logic, and configuration.

Hereâ€™s a look at the key files and folders.

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- src
  - assets/
  - components/
  - layouts/
  - lib/
  - pages/
  - server
    - api/
    - db/
  - styles/
    - globals.css
  - trpc/
- vite.config.ts
- tsconfig.json
- biome.jsonc
</FileTree>



#### `src/assets`

A home for any static assets that are used by your application. This is the perfect place to store images, fonts, or SVGs.

#### `src/components`

This folder contains all of your reusable SolidJS components. Think of these as the building blocks of your UI: buttons, form inputs, cards, modals, etc. By keeping them here, you can easily import and use them across different pages and layouts.

#### `src/layouts`

Layouts are components that wrap your pages. They are used to define a common structure that is shared across multiple routes, such as a site header, a footer, or a navigation sidebar. Your `LayoutDefault.tsx` is a great example of this.

#### `src/lib`

A general-purpose directory for utility functions and helpers. This is a great place for things like a `cn` (classname) utility for merging Tailwind classes, date formatting functions, or other bits of logic that don't belong in a specific component or page.

#### `src/pages`

This is where your routes are defined. Following Vike's file-based routing, each file or folder inside `pages` corresponds to a route in your application. 

#### `src/server`

As the name implies, everything inside this folder runs **only on the server**. This is a critical security boundary. Your database connections, secret keys, and Hono API routes live here. Code in this directory will never be exposed to the client.

* `server/api/`: This is where your backend API logic lives, built with Hono. Crucially, this is where you define your **tRPC routers and procedures** (queries and mutations). You then expose this tRPC router as Hono middleware, creating a single, powerful endpoint for all your type-safe data fetching.
* `server/db/`: Contains all your database configurations. This is where you'll define your **Drizzle ORM schema** (the files that declare your tables) and create your Drizzle client instance for interacting with the database.



#### `src/styles`

Your global CSS styles live here. The `globals.css` file is the place to define your base styles, import fonts, and include your core Tailwind CSS directives.

#### `src/trpc`

This folder holds the **client-side setup for tRPC**. It contains the tRPC query client, which integrates with TanStack Query (`@tanstack/solid-query`), allowing you to call your backend procedures with fully-typed hooks like `createQuery` and `createMutation` in your SolidJS components.


#### `vite.config.ts`

This is the configuration file for Vike (and Vite), the high-performance build tool that powers VHS. You can customize the build process here, add Vite plugins, and define aliases.

#### `tsconfig.json`

This file configures the TypeScript compiler. It defines the rules for how your code is checked for errors and sets up helpful features like the `@/*` path alias, which makes importing modules from your `src` directory much cleaner.

#### `biome.jsonc`

This file configures **Biome**, our all-in-one tool for linting and formatting. It helps enforce a consistent code style and catches common errors across the entire codebase, keeping everything clean and readable.
